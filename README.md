A C# library for creating and calling REST services

Currently at the concept stage only, I've been working on some REST services in my day job, and I've come up with what I think is an elegant solution.

I'll put a first cut of the code up here as soon as I can and then see what sort of interest there is in using the API, and, hopefully, people contributing to it.

The base code is generously made available by ITV, the largest independent broadcaster in the UK - [www.itv.com](http://www.itv.com)
